          <h3>Cancellation Terms</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure a fair and consistent process, our cancellation policy is
            based on notice time and service status at the time of cancellation:

          <ul>
            <li>
              Cancellations made <strong>24 hours before pickup</strong> are
              eligible for a full or partial refund.
            </li>
            <li>
              Cancellations made <strong>within 24 hours</strong> of pickup may
              incur administrative charges.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No refunds</strong> will be provided for no-shows or
              cancellations made after the vehicle has been dispatched.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Refund Processing</h3>
